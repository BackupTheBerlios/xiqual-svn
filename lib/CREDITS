People/organisations:

Thanks to Electronic Arts for coming up with a decent,
generic format for all sorts of files.

Stepan Rutz showed me his nice little daemonkit library one day on IRC,
and that got me thinking about select()-servers. I ended up writing my
own code, but getting the idea served was a good thing :)
(http://daemonkit.sourceforge.net, I think was the URL)

Spencer Low's tutorial on the same subject was also helpful.

Thanks to the wxWindows guys for a neat cross-platform GUI toolkit.
I use it for many tools nowadays (http://www.wxwindows.org), and
the license is probably the nicest I've seen.
