I'm currently implementing support for SCons, a great tool for
replacing the horrid, evil, wicked auto tools.

Obviously you will need SCons installed to use this build system.
So hopefully we can get rid of configure and make completely, which
will depend on Evilidler, but he also has a sever dislike of the
auto tools.

----- BUILD -----
Just type:

scons


----- INSTALL -----
To install xiqual:

scons install


----- CLEAN -----
For cleaning all the build files and directories, just use:

scons -c


----- UNINSTALL -----
To clean all built files and remove installed files also:

scons -c install



More work still needs to be done on the SCons scripts, as no
autoconf type library checking as yet been inplemented. -Biomechanism.
