<BLOCKQUOTE>
Create gadget, and automatically set certain tags.
The LBT_TOGGLE tag is set if type is GAD_TOGGLE.
LUI_SCREEN is also automatically set to xig->screen,
but any LUI_SCREEN tags you supply will override this.

<P><h3>Known button types</h3>
<ul>
<li>GAD_BUTTON</li>
Ordinary clickable button, with optional highlight images.
The highlight image for the pressed-in state doesn't really
make much sense, but it would make you able to change a
button to toggle state on the fly.

<P><li>GAD_TOGGLE</li>
Like a clickable button, except the button stays pressed
until you click again. The pressed-in highlight image is
useful for these.

<P><li>GAD_LIST</li>
A very simple list with a field above and below that
scrolls its contents up and down, respectively.
It relies on hooks from the up/down buttons to tell
what item to show as the first one (just a number),
the its ondraw() hook gets his number and must update
the list contents.

<P><li>GAD_MENU</li>
Creates a menu header (walks like a button, quacks like
a button) which pops up a list of further buttons when
clicked. No layout management is done yet, so the items
will just appear below eachother. The menu itself handles
highlighting of the menuitems. Its inputarea changes size
temporarily while the menuitems are displayed.

<P><li>GAD_MESSAGE</li>
This is a modal message box with one (confirm) button.
For those who don't speak GUI, modal means all other
gadgets are unavailable while this box awaits input.
It handles its own highlighting of items, and may
possibly have a scrolling list of text, if the text
is too large for its displayable area.

<P><li>GAD_CONFIRM</li>
This is another modal message box, but with both a
confirm and cancel button.
