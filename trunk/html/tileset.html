Create a tileset from a tileset definition and images.

<P>Usage:

<P><em>tileset</em> name.t

<P>The definition file can have any name, but .t is the
postfix I'll be using. A tileset definition refers
to one or more images (loadable by SDL_image) to cut
sections from. The resulting tileset contains graphics
with a masking colour defined (the colour that doesn't
get copied in blits). It does not define WHAT each
tile is for (sprites, terrain, icons).

<P>
<h2>Definition file format</h2>
The file is divided into sections. Descriptions follow here.

<P><b>[tileset]</b>: The first section, normally. It can be anywhere
in the file, but it must be unique.

<P><h3>Variables in the [tileset] section</h3>

<P>Variables are set in the usual way of INI-style files,
with "name = definition" at most once per line.

<P><ul>
<li>name</li> A string; the name to refer to this set by.

<P><li>filename</li> This is a string containing the name you
want to use for the output tileset. Usually ends in .iff or .tiles
or some other vaguely descriptive surname.

<P><li>size</li> Size in pixels of each tile in this tileset.
A tileset must have all its tiles the same size. Format: Either
width followed by a space, then height, or WIDTHxHEIGHT.
<br>For example:<br>size = 32x32

<P><li>maskcol</li> The transparent colour. The format is hexadecimal:
<br>maskcol = 0xnnnnnn
<br> The 0x prefix is optional.

<P><li>author</li> You may specify the name of the artist/packager
with this variable. Not required, but the artists will thank you
for it if they're any good, and hate your guts otherwise.

<P><li>comment</li> Another optional variable. Any string can go here.
</ul>

<P>The next type of section can appear multiple times. It specifies
files to grab images from. The section name is <b>[source]</b>.

<P><h3>Variables in [source] sections</h3>

<P><ul>
<li>image</li> Name of an image file in any format known to
SDL_image. Suggested formats: XPM, PNG or TGA.
Non-lossy compression is preferred, as JPEG and similar will
probably mess up the pixels  in transparent colours.
Proper transparency support from PNG is planned, though.

<P><li>count</li> The number of tiles that the image holds.
The program starts in the upper left corner, then moves right
until reaching the rightmost edge, then proceeds to the next
line of tiles until <b>count</b> tiles have been grabbed.
This variable can be left out if there is only one tile in
the source image.
</ul>

<P><h3>Variables usable in all sections</h3>
<ul>
<li>xborder, yborder</li> These variables make it possible to set
the width/height of any borders between blocks in the source image.
Borders to the right and below are accounted for with this. First
tile will be grabbed from position 0,0 in the image.

<P><li>xoffset, yoffset</li> Like above, except the border is
considered left/above each tile. With these variables, and some
experimentation, you can grab tilesets off the net easily.
</ul>

<P><h3>IFF chunk types</h3>
Here is a list of the different chunks that a tileset contains.
The FORM type is <b>TILS</b>.

<P><ul>
<li>NAME</li> A name to use when referring to this tileset.
<li>AUTH</li> Name of the author.
<li>ANNO</li> File comment.
<li>Mask</li> The mask colour (24-bit RGB colour, big-endian).
<li>Size</li> Two Uint16 integers with width and height of the
tiles in the tileset. Big-endian format.
<li>Tile</li>A zlib-compressed tile in 24-bit RGB mode.
The first ulong (big-endian) in the data is the uncompressed size.
</ul>

<P><b>Note:</b> If image names are not specified by full paths,
the program will attempt to load them relative to the definition
file. In other words, the working directory is set to
wherever the definitions are.
