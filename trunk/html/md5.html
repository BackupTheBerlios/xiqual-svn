<BLOCKQUOTE>Simple MD5-summing program.
<h3>Usage</h3>
<em>md5</em> [-b] [-v] [-c] | [file...]

<P>md5 generates MD5 checksums, like md5sum(1), but no wildcards are
properly supported in the program itself. This should not be a problem
if using Bash or similar shells. On Win32, getting Unix Utilities is
recommended for developers, anyway.

<P>The -v flag prints each filename and status regardless of whether it
has a checksum or not. Use alongside the -c option.

<P>If -c appears on the command line, the files specified are expected to
be md5sum output as generated with normal operation. The filenames to
verify are gathered from these files, and each invalid sum is printed
to the standard output. Use -v if you want everything printed.

<P>The -b flag does nothing but print an asterisk before the filename.

<P><h3>TODO</h3>
Implement -c and -v, plus wildcards.</BLOCKQUOTE>
