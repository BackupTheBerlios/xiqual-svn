Clean Debian dpkg status files from purged/not-installed entries.
I've had no joy finding a tool to do just this. Here's one that not only removes
"purged" and "deinstalled ok not-installed" entries from those files, but also
illustrates some use of Xiqual's basic functions. There are no known side-effects
yet. If you get to know any of them, let me know, too.

<P>To use the program, find your megabyte-sized status file (or whatever the bloated
size is), which usually resides in /var/lib/dpkg/ under the name "status". Become
the superuser and make a copy of it. Don't skip this step; if this program mangles
your file, I can laugh at your stupidity.

<P>Next, run the program on the file, redirecting the standard output to where you want
your clean status file to go. Example:

<P>statuscleaner status.backup > status

<P>Now, if this isn't a week-fresh or younger Debian system, you're going to see an
awful lot of text printed on the console. This is stderr, which you may also
redirect to a file, if need be. Last in the output is the number of entries that
were deemed unnecessary.

<P>If you go through the status file manually after this, you might still find some
entries with status "deinstall" (among other things). These probably have a few
configuration files lying around. It would be wise to check these, if it's anything
imporant like a highscore list for some game, or you can just dpkg --purge that, too,
if it's just some server configuration file.

<P>Tip: Take everything written in any computer documentation with a grain of salt.

<P>Statuscleaner was written in a matter of minutes without time, motivation or reason
to read any Debian documents. If you end up screwing your system up beyond the
healing powers of even dpkg -i, I want the details for my list of dastardly deeds.
