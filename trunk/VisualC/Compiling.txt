Visual C++:
To compile Xiqual programs without SDL (only relying on xitools, xinet,
and/or xicgi), add the .lib files to your project, then specify the
full path to the Xiqual include directory in Settings->C/C++->Preprocessor.

If using SDL, you will (by default) require SDL.lib, SDLmain.lib,
SDL_mixer.lib and SDL_image.lib. If your mixer library isn't statically
compiled against Vorbis libraries, you also need ogg.lib, vorbis.lib
and vorbisfile.lib, or _static versions of those. Header directories for
each set of libraries should be added, too. zlib is usually required by
some of the SDL libraries.

(Anyone want to write a wizard?)

Grab the installer packages with pre-compiled SDL libraries if you're
not in the mood to compile all of the dependencies yourself.

MingW32:
Unsupported. I don't care.
