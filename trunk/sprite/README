Here are sprites/tiles used to test the tileset program included with
Xiqual 0.7.0+. The PNGs have been through pngcrush to squeeze out any
unnecessary bits, but will grow a bit when converted to tilesets, since
each image is compressed individually then.

To create the IFF, run tileset with the definition file as its sole argument:
	tileset narya.t

Look through the .t file if you want to learn the format. It's pretty
simple and straight forward.

(I've tried bzip2, but it performs VERY badly on such small files!
Xiqual will stick to zlib for this purpose.)

(NOTE: This utility will probably remain, but I hope to get a tileset
editor finished sometime)
