Xiqual is only available as a static library. There are several reasons for this,
but mostly because users shouldn't be burdened with another library that
will break a program when you upgrade it. The API *will* mutate enough to
break things, as there are quite sloppy coding practices in action here.


Requirements:
SDL 1.2.4 or newer must be installed, as well as the matching SDL_image.
Both are available at http://libsdl.org, in the Libraries section.
Xiqual is built with 1.2.5 now, and will follow the more updated versions
as they are released.

GCC compilers up to 3.3 have been tried on Linux, and VC++ up to 6 on 
Win32. GNU Make is the only make utility recommended by Autoconf.

Some Unix-oid system is preferred - development happens in Linux, with
an occasional full compile in Windows. FreeBSD/NetBSD etc. has worked in
the past, and should still compile and run the test programs as long as
SDL is supported. Any processor achitecture should work, unless it works
off some endianness unheard of till now.


Nice to have:
SDL_mixer availability will let you initialise it from Xiqual's startup code.


Quick install tip:
At your command line, type:
	./autogen.sh
from the Xiqual directory to generate proper makefiles for your system.

If you need a different GNU C compiler, or even non-GNU, try:
	CC=gcc-x.y ./autogen.sh
or something like it. Replace 'gcc-x.y' with a valid binary.
