All:
Some functions are incomplete (IFF was reduced to simple FORMs,
preferences code could do with some extra functions and CGI functions
aren't all fully written..)

Linux:
Compiles without errors. No other suspicious activity spotted.

Win32:
Had to make a custom strndup(), as this is missing. This internal
function is also used in place of strndup() on Linux, as there are some
issues with it. Various typedefs had to be made just for this platform;
the code compiled fine on VC++ 5, but had lost some definitions in the
v6 headerfiles.

xinet:
Not sure about the handling of resolved hostnames yet. Needs some
testing of most functions to be 100% sure it's working. Read/write
functions are being tested, with automatic handling of command strings
also being added now.

xixml:
Writing to file isn't entirely perfect. Drops some symbols occasionally.
Will be fixed when I find the bug.

lui:
Message boxes are randomly crashing.
Tilesets are not always working for buttons.
