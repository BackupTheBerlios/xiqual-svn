Required functions:
Buttons: Image-based ones are done; make a subset that draws shadowed 
gadgets like gadtools? Using images from tilesets is also a bit flaky.
Think leper colony.

Lists: Left-right orientation next

Message boxes: Still unwritten

Text entry: Field with or without image for typing in text (alternately 
shown as asterisks)

Tabbed pages: "Magic" pages that select contents in a large area, 
changing the inputs list to match the displayed gadgets in the current 
page

Sliders: Separate gadget+combo gadget (proper listview) made from 
slider+view

Popup-menus: Menus should be defined as popping up over certain objects 
only, anywhere onscreen or near the menubar. The anywhere menu shouldn't 
show if the mouse is over an object at all. Maybe gadgets should have an 
entry in its structure that contains a menu gadget.

Radio-buttons: Composite gadget made from two toggle buttons and some 
text. Should be fairly easy to make.
